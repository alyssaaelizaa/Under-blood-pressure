# Under-blood-pressure

This GitHub repository contains the code and analysis for an assignment that explores linear regression models applied to a dataset focused on the relationship between blood pressure and various factors. The dataset includes variables like age, time spent in an urban environment, weight, and more. The project follows a systematic approach, including data visualization, model building, and thorough model evaluation to assess linearity, the distribution of residuals, and constant variability. By comparing two linear regression models, one examining urban_frac_life and another with weight as an explanatory variable for systolic blood pressure, we aim to determine which model provides better predictions and adheres to the essential assumptions of linear regression. This project serves as a valuable exercise for understanding and applying linear regression modeling techniques.
